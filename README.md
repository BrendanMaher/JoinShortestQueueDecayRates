Python code project from Honours Project course MATH4905 Carleton University                                            
For any Double Queue the decay rates of probabilities, of how large either or both queues get, are hard to calculate    
Shorcuts Kernel method and Doublesided Quasi Birth Birth Death process are compared to Iterative Power method
