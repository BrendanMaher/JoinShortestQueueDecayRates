# JoinShortestQueueDecayRates
1st December 2014 Python code project from Honours Project course MATH4905 Carleton University                          
For any Double Queue the decay rates of probabilities, of how large either or both queues get, are hard to calculate    
Shorcuts Kernel method and Doublesided Quasi Birth Birth Death process are compared to Iterative Power method           
The Python code provided makes a Double Queue class instance with chosen joining and serving probabilities              
The decay rates of large queues can be calulated with shortcut or brute force methods built into the code               
Results are shown in the PDF where, it seems some Double Queues have the shortcuts failing to match brute force
